"""
This question is asked by Amazon. Given two arrays of numbers, where 
the first array is a subset of the second array, return an array 
containing all the next greater elements for each element in the 
first array, in the second array. If there is no greater element for 
any element, output -1 for that number.

Ex: Given the following arraysâ€¦

nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2], 
return [-1, 3, -1] because no element in nums2 is greater than 4, 3 is 
the first number in nums2 greater than 1, and no element in nums2 is greater than 2.

nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4], 
return [3, -1] because 3 is the first greater element that occurs in nums2 after 2 
and no element is greater than 4.

  # Time: O(n)
  # Space: O(n)
  nextGreatest = dict()
  stack = []

  for num in nums2:
    while len(stack) != 0 and stack[-1] < num:
      nextGreatest[stack.pop()] = num
    
    stack.append(num)

  for i in range(len(nums1)):
    nums1[i] = nextGreatest.get(nums1[i], -1)
  
  return nums1


assert greaterElements([4, 1, 2], [1, 3, 4, 2]) == [-1, 3, -1]
assert greaterElements([2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) == [3, -1]
